# Assignment 2
## Cassandra Soto
Hi! I decided to take this course because it matches the pattern to obtain a bachelors degree in Media Arts. This is one of the many courses that I must take to meet the requirements. In addition, if I do not take this course and pass it, I will not be able to reach my goal of obtaining my degree, which is very important to me. Today, I am taking this course because I wish to complete it.
1. I can work in different software programs other than the Microsoft and Adobe Suite.
2. I am learning to utilize computer language in another format that I am not familiar with.
3. I hope to learn as much as I can this course.
