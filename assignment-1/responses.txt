The web is different from the internet. The web is connects information and the internet connects people through a “wire.” The web is a place to access information. It is a place where you can give and receive information. The internet is a “wire” that needs to be connected to ports in order for there to receive and give information to or through the web. 
Using the internet: The mechanics behind it; it is a wire that is connected to computers. 
A directory is a file system that is similar to a tree. There is a main file (or root) and the sub folders branch out of the main root, just like tree branches.  Relationship terms are used to better describe the folders. For example, the main folder can be named “top priority,” and the sub file can be named “second priority.” In this case the “parent” file is the “top priority,” and the “secondary priority” is the “child of top priority.” It is a great way to guide users to file places. In addition, grandparent and grandchild are terms that can be used as well. 
VCS files can be more easily tracked, and to be able to determine differences.
